## How Generative AI Models are Solving the Problem

ATRONS leverages Generative AI models to enhance the platform's functionality. The chosen Generative AI models, such as the `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest` model, have been fine-tuned to read and give responses based on the peoples comments. These models utilize cutting-edge techniques in computer vision and natural language processing to generate accurate and meaningful responses.
